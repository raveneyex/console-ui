# Console UI

An HTML-first UI portfolio.
My goal with this file would be to document the evolution of the project: from just a bunch of static files in plain HTML/CSS/JS to wherever fate and needs take me.

Note: I don't suffer from american brain-rot so all date formats are DD/MM/YYYY. Deal with it.

Started by creating a root folder for the project which I very uncreatively dubbed `console-ui`; I then added folders for the HTML, CSS, and JS files:

```
> mkdir console-ui
> mkdir console-ui/html
> mkdir console-ui/css
> mkdir console-ui/js
```

And a couple of initial files

```
> touch console-ui/index.html
> touch console-ui/css/main.css
> touch console-ui/css/console.cs
```

This is a good time to start handling the evolution of the different files in the project, so let's start git:

```
> cd console-ui
> git init .
```

And let's save the files in a first commit:

```
> git add .
> git commit -m "console-ui: initial folder structure"
```

Now let's start adding some code. 
In `index.html` let's add some basic HTML boilerplate:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Console UI</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

And then some pre-formatted text to have something to test out styles on. I'm just gonn

```
```
